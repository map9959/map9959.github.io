This should be up and running! Welcome to my Github page; I hope to keep this updated going forward. Most of the work was gathering information from various sources and copy-pasting from my resume to standardized JSON format. The work will become easier as the ball gets rolling. To be honest, this post mostly exists to satisfy the dead link checker. If you somehow found this anyway, congratulations, and please hire me.
