Hi! I'm Michael Paciullo, a recent graduate from NYU, software engineer, and researcher. I have past experience in numerical linear algebra, physical simulation, and computer graphics, and I am always looking to learn and build!

I worked at NYU's Geometric Computing Lab as an undergraduate, learning about the finite element method and contributing to [polysolve](https://github.com/polyfem/polysolve), a linear and non-linear solver API. I worked on another matrix factorization project at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/), the research division of the Simons Foundation.

I am currently working at [Standard Practice](https://standardpractice.ai), building AI for healthcare! Feel free to connect with me on any of the social media links below. For any industry-related inquiries, please contact me via LinkedIn. For academic inquiries, feel free to email me.
